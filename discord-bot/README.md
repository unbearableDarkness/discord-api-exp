# Discord api experimantation including my first bot
This weird and bizarre bot allows you to:  
**1.** Get a random quote from zenquotes.io.  
**2.** Get a random quote from a movie you want (simply change the function name and the filename).  
**3.** Get the id of most recent post on the most active 4chan boards.  
**4.** Ask 8ball something.   
**5.** Let the bot insult someone (but a in friendly way).
